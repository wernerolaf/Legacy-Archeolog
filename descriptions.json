  "Commit ID: fabbfe76f07f668ea8b4502522dc2f401d4f19bd\nMessage: Fixed issue closes #46 (#52)\n\nPurpose: \nThis commit aimed to address issue #46. The issue likely had something to do with the improper session and term form handling in the file \"apps/corecode/views.py\". The improvement has streamlined the code and might have solved the error or bug associated with it.\n\nChanges:\nThe change in the file consists of simplifying the creation of form. The previous approach was a bit convoluted where the form was created with request.POST and initial instance. It was replaced by a more straightforward approach where the form is only created with request.POST, improving readability and maintainability.\n\nList of changes:\n\n* apps/corecode/views.py -- Streamlined form creation in \"post\" method of the CurrentSessionAndTermView class and removed unnecessary 'initial' attribute in form creation.",

This was an important fix because without this, the page could not display any data when the student list was empty, potentially having a negative user experience.\n\nChanges: A key change was made in the Django template language code in the student_list.html file. Namely, the iteration object was changed from 'object_list' to 'students', which indicates that there was probably a variable naming conflict or unreadable data before the modification.\n\nList of changes:\n* apps/students/templates/students/student_list.html -- The iteration object in the template has been changed from 'object_list' to 'students' to fix a bug where no students were displayed when the student list was empty.",

The validation was missing and thus allowed the input of non-valid phone numbers. Speedy action was needed to avoid complications originating from malformed data.\n\nChanges: The changes in the staffs/models.py file resulted in 13 lines added and 17 lines deleted. Phone number validation was reintroduced by adding a RegexValidator for the \"mobile_number\" field.\n\nList of changes:\n* staffs/models.py -- The RegexValidator has been added to properly validate mobile numbers and prevent invalid input.",
  "Commit ID: 62bbf289ee8aeb77083bd858a35a4e5c7ee35f8d\nMessage: Phone number validation under staff app. Found missing.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this commit is to include the phone number validation feature in the staff application. This feature was missing in the application earlier leading to inconsistent and incorrect input of phone numbers. As phone numbers are an important element for contact information, this validation is crucial to structure the input data correctly.\n\nChanges: \nThe primary change in this commit is in the 'staffs/models.py' file. Here, the phone number validation logic is included by calling the 'RegexValidator' for the 'mobile_number' field of the 'Staff' model. This RegexValidator is designed to accept numbers in a certain format. Specifically, it ensures that the phone number entered is numeric and within the length of 10 to 15 digits. If the entered format doesn't match the regex criteria, an error message is shown.\n\nList of Changes:\n* staffs/models.py -- Included 'RegexValidator' for the 'mobile_number' field in the 'Staff' model. Replaced the unrestricted 'mobile_number' field with a regex-validated field to ensure numerical inputs ranging from 10 to 15 characters in length.",

The original regex expression only allowed for mobile numbers between 10 and 12 digits, but it was decided that this range did not cover all potential valid phone numbers. The regex validator for the mobile number has been updated to cater to these decisions.\n\nChanges: The RegexValidator for mobile numbers in the Student model has been adjusted to allow numbers between 10-15 digits instead of the previous 10-12 digits. This change has been adequately tested.\n\nList of changes:\n* students/models.py -- Adjusted the parameters for the RegexValidator used for mobile number validation. Specifically, it now checks for numbers of length 10 to 15 digits instead of 10 to 12.\n",

It involved introducing regex validation for student data and also improving the code formatting for better readability and adherence to coding standards. These changes are vital in ensuring that the application collects and processes valid data thereby improving the accuracy of its operations. Additionally, neat and standardized code formatting promotes code maintainability.\n\nChanges:\nThe changes involve the addition of validation based on regular expression and the structuring of code with correct indentation and in compliance with the coding standard. \n\nList of changes:\n* students/models.py -- The model for the student was adjusted with regex validation for mobile number field; and appropriate indentations were inserted for improved readability. The 'mobile_num_regex' attribute was removed and the 'parent_mobile_number' attribute no longer uses it for validation, suggesting that the regex implementation might have been modified or moved elsewhere.

This involved introducing regular expression (regex) validation for specific data fields, and restructuring the code so that the indentation and coding standards adhere to the project's guidelines. The regular expression validation is designed to ensure data input into the system follows a specific format, cutting down on potential errors and enhancing the security of the overall system.\n\nThe primary change lies in the \"students/models.py\" file where 20 sections of code were added while 23 sections were removed or modified. The transformed code became easier to read and edit, and more compliant with standard Python syntax, making this change not just a bug fix, but a code optimization as well.\n\nList of Changes:\n* students/models.py -- This file has been changed substantially. The biggest change is the addition of regex validation, which ensures adherence to required data formats. Code has also been restructured according to the project's coding standards with improved indentation.",
